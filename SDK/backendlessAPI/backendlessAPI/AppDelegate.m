// FBSample logic
// Whether it is in applicationWillTerminate, in applicationDidEnterBackground, or in some other part
// of your application, it is important that you close an active session when it is no longer useful
// to your application; if a session is not properly closed, a retain cycle may occur between the block
// and an object that holds a reference to the session object; close releases the handler, breaking any
// inadvertant retain cycles
- (void)applicationWillTerminate:(UIApplication *)application {
    // FBSample logic
    // if the app is going away, we close the session if it is open
    // this is a good idea because things may be hanging off the session, that need
    // releasing (completion block, etc.) and other components in the app may be awaiting
    // close notification in order to do cleanup

// when the user is part-way through a login; You can check for the FBSessionStateCreatedOpenening

// application may choose to notify the user that they switched away from the Facebook application without
// completely logging in
