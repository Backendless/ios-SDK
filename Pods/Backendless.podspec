	Backendless is a development and a run-time platform. It helps software developers to create 
	mobile and desktop applications while removing the need for server-side coding. The platform 
	consists of five core backend services which developers typically spend time implementing for
	each new applications. These services include:

		User Service – facilitates user registrations, login, logout, session management.
		Data Service – is responsible for data management – storage, retrieval, updates and deletion.
		Messaging Service – handles message publishing, broadcast, filtered message delivery and native mobile push notifications.
		Files Service – is responsible for file uploads, downloads and file sharing.
		Geo-Location Service – supports geo spatial data imports and geo queries.

		The Backendless services can be accessed through an easy-to-use APIs which we packaged into our 
		SDKs. The behavior of the services and the business logic behind them can be customized through 
		the Development Console.
